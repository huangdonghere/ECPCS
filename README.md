# ECPCS

This repository provides the Matlab source code for the `Ensemble Clustering by Propagating Cluster-wise Similarities (ECPCS)` approach, which is further developed into two sub-algorithms, i.e., ECPCS with hierarchical consensus function (ECPCS-HC) and ECPCS with with meta-cluster based consensus function (ECPCS-MC).
