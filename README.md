# ECPCS

This repository provides the Matlab source code for the `Ensemble Clustering by Propagating Cluster-wise Similarities (ECPCS)` approach, which is further developed into two ensemble clustering algorithms, i.e., `ECPCS with hierarchical consensus function (ECPCS-HC)` and `ECPCS with with meta-cluster based consensus function (ECPCS-MC)`.
